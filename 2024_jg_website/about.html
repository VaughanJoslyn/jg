			<h2>A History in Turf</h2>

			<p><strong>Joslyn is a well-known name in the turf business.</strong></p>
			<p>In February 2014, Greg and Cassie Joslyn founded Joslyn Group. They saw a need for a high-quality personalised service that was built on trust and integrity. In 2020, they joined forces with Diamond Valley Excavations, which expanded their team to 30+ staff with a variety of experience in all facets of natural and synthetic, earthmoving engineering and excavation services.</p>
			<p>Their clients and projects include the City of Whittlesea, Monash City Council, the home of the Matildas - La Trobe University, Epping Recreation Reserve, Aegis Park - the home of the North Melbourne Football Club and others.</p>
